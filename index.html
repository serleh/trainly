          <h1 class="">Where Potential Meets Opportunity</h1>
          <p>
            At Trainly, we believe that every young person deserves access to
            the tools and support needed to thrive in the digital world. Through
            hands-on tech training, mentorship, and real-world projects, we
            equip underrepresented youth with the skills to build meaningful
            careers, solve real problems, and shape their futures with
            confidence.

        <h2>Why</h2>
        <p>
          At Trainly, we see a world where opportunity shouldn’t be limited by
          geography or background. Many talented young people lack access to
          quality tech education, and we’re here to change that. By bridging the
          gap between potential and opportunity, we’re not just teaching code —
          we’re unlocking futures, building confidence, and creating pathways to
          meaningful careers in the digital economy.
